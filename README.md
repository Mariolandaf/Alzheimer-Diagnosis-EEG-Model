# Alzheimer-Diagnosis-EEG-Model
Machine learning model for Alzheimer's diagnosis using EEG data. The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify EEG signals, determining if they belong to patients with Alzheimer's, healthy individuals, or other conditions. The model utilizes Python for analysis and MATLAB for preprocessing.
